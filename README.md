# Ruby PolyTree Nodes Project

## Learning Goals
* Know how to implement a polytree using polytree nodes
* Know how to implement BFS and DFS for your polytree* 
* Be able to explain the differences between BFS and DFS and when one might be preferred

## Class PolyTreeNode
* An #initialize(value) method that sets the value, and starts parent as nil, and children to an empty array.
* A #parent method that returns the node's parent.
* A #children method that returns an array of children of a node.
* A #value method that returns the value stored at the node.
